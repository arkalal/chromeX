# Project Details

I want to build a chrome extension using which users will be able to write anything inside any input boxes in the apps, which they will open under the chrome browser this may involve opening gmail.com and writing emails inside it using AI. So with the help of the extension user can write any content inside any of the apps input area using AI so we will be using open API for that I mean the GPT4o model.

The main use cases are that inside the input box in any app, user can type anything in it, and using our chrome extension, they can restyle their content that they have written inside the input box using the help of AI or they can take help of the AI to write any content inside the input boxes that may involve writing content inside the Google Doc page or like inside gmail.com under the compose, they can write an email from scratch using the help of AI or they have already written an email and they want to refine that email using the help of AI. So the main use case is that if they have opened any app inside their chrome browser in any input or where they can write something, they can write it using our chrome extension AI model or they can refine their text Using our extension AI that they have already written under the input section of that particular app that they have opened inside their chrome browser.

Another use case is that if they have opened any doc or any Wikipedia or any kinds of page under their chrome browser, now they can use our chrome extension chatbot to get a summary of that particular doc that they have opened inside our chrome browser that may be an API doc or any Wikipedia article or any blog article or anything.

Now they can be also able to chat with that particular doc data that they have opened inside our chrome browser which can be, for example, any API documentation page or any blog article page or any Wikipedia page, etc using our extension chatbot, so the main feature is that getting the summary of that particular doc that they have opened inside their browser, and also chatting with the doc data inside our extension chatbot.

Another feature is that they can also take notes real time inside the chrome extension anytime and they can save their notes inside our app with proper titles, tags, categories and all and later can view it in our app.

A cool feature is that the notes that they have saved that they can also view by opening a new blank tab inside the chrome browser. So once the tab will be open by default, we will show them their saved notes in our app and also they can also create a new note and Write a note and save it inside that new opened blank tab inside their chrome browser.
